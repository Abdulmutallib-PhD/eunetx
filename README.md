# EUNetX: Automated Brain Tumor Segmentation in CT Medical Images

## Overview

This project presents **EUNetX**, a novel deep learning architecture inspired by UNet++ for automated segmentation of brain tumors from CT medical images.  
The model improves segmentation accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalizability over existing models like UNet++, TransUNet, Swin-PANet, and MedT.

EUNetX integrates extended skip connections and a lightweight feature fusion (LFF) mechanism to better capture complex tumor boundaries with high efficiency.

## Motivation

Manual segmentation of medical images by clinicians is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to observer variability.  
This project addresses these challenges by automating segmentation using a robust deep learning model trained and evaluated on a curated brain tumor CT dataset.

## Key Features[evaluation_metrics.csv](csv%2Fevaluation_metrics.csv)

- Custom CNN architecture based on UNet++
- Extended skip connections & lightweight feature fusion
- Trained on **16,000 CT datasets. NOTE, DATASET CAN BE GIVEN ON REQUEST DUE TO ETHICAL CONSIDERATION**
- Outperforms baseline models in DSC, IoU, and computational efficiency
- Supports stratified k-fold cross-validation
